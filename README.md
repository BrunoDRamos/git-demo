Many people want to know the “secret” to good body composition—the one magic
bullet. But as a registered dietitian with years of working with climbers and
other athletes, I can assure you that, first, there is no one secret—just
smarter approaches to nourishing. Second, there is no one “best” macronutrient;
carbs, fat, and protein each have multiple biological purposes, so it’s unwise
to entirely eliminate or focus on any one. And third, more is not always
better with anything “beneficial” to our nutritional health—instead, we should
focus on timing, portion size, and listening to our bodies. Still, that said,
I’m willing to bet most climbers could step their game up simply by eating
more protein.
